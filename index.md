## Creating a generative track

In the summer of 2022, I took UC Berkeley's Music 158A: Music and Computing with CNMAT Technologies. For my final project, I set out to synthesize a convincing harp sound. I didn't quite get there, but I did like the sounds I created, so I used some other tools I learned in the class to create some generative music.
